# A-Star-Visualizer-and-Maze-Generator

A maze generation and pathfinding algorithm visualization, implemented in python using pygames.

The depth-first search algorithm along with a recursive backtracking algorithm is implemented to generate the maze.
The A* algorithm paired with the depth-first search is used as the pathfinding algorithm

Controls:
- click a square to set it as the starting point; click another to set it as the ending point
- when the start and end are set, click to add additional walls
- right click to erase the start/end/wall block and set the square as empty
