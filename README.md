# A-Star-Visualizer-and-Maze-Generator

A maze generation and pathfinding algorithm visualization, implemented in python using pygames.

The depth-first search algorithm along with a recursive backtracking algorithm is implemented to generate the maze.
A simplified version of the A* algorithm paired with the depth-first search is used as the pathfinding algorithm
